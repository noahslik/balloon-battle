# What is this?
This is a simple program for a robot kart controlled by a Raspberry Pi. The kart is supposed to be an arena enclosed by walls.
The kart simply moves forward until hitting a wall and then turns left or right depending on if the kart hit the wall on the right or left side.

The kart has support for a speaker setup. This can be configured under "#AUDIO INIT".
